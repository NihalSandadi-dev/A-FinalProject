# A-FinalProject
- Our A* Algorithm implementation is located in: [A* Implementation code](ak_a_star_impl.py).
- Our Dijkstra's Algorithm is located in: [Dijkstra's Algorithm code](<Dijkstra's Algorithm.py>).
- [Helper Functions](helper_functions.py) contains miscellaneous code that we wrote to use for algorithm implementation and input generation.
- We have also included sample visualizations for how our input graphs look like 
- To run the code, make sure you first install all the dependencies and packages mentioned in our requirements.txt
